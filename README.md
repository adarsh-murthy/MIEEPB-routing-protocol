# MIEEPB-routing-protocol
Mobile Sink Improved Energy Efficient PEGASIS Based Routing protocol:

We have considered 100 sensors in our model. In this protocol, the sensors are divided into 4 quadrants. Each quadrant will form a chain. The sensor will connect to its immediate closest neighbor. For each round, a cluster-head is chosen. The cluster head is chosen based on the highest residual energy/distance to sink ratio. Which means that the cluster-head can change for every round. The goal is to prolong the life of the network. Stats like round number when first node dies (for a particular quadrant), when last node dies, when all die, etc.
